# ML-Deployment [Work in Progress]

Here, I aim to explore different resources and tech stacks to be able to deploy ML models quickly and easily. Building a great ML infrastrucuture is often a difficult one. It involves messing with Kubernetes, Docker an AWS account or Azure or Google Cloud.
For Research Engineers or startups it often takes alot of resources to be able to build this infrastructure. Here, I aim to explore the opportunity and limitations of methods of deployment that don't require such extensive expertises.

1.Modal
Modal takes your code, puts it in a container, and executes it in the cloud.
Where does it run? Modal runs it in its own cloud environment. The benefit is that we solve all the hard infrastructure problems for you, so you don’t have to do anything. You don’t need to mess with Kubernetes, Docker or even an AWS account.
